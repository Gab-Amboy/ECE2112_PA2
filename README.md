## Problems

#### **#1 NORMALIZATION PROBLEM:** create a random 5 x 5 ndarray and store it to variable X. Normalize X. Save your normalized ndarray as X_normalized.npy

#### **#2 DIVISIBLE BY 3 PROBLEM:** Create a 10-by-10 array which are the squares of the first 100 positive integers. From this ndarray, determine all the elements that are divisible by 3. Save the result as div_by_3.npy

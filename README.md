# Experiment 2: Numerical Python (NumPy)
##### Name: Amboy, John Gabriel D.
##### Section: 2ECE-A
##### Date Submitted: September 1, 2024

## I. Intended Learning Outcomes
#### CILO1: Identify methods and techniques to solve complex engineering problems using Python.
#### CILO2: Use Python to solve unknown variables in complex electronics problems based on engineering, science, and math principles.

## Problems

#### **#1 NORMALIZATION PROBLEM:** create a random 5 x 5 ndarray and store it to variable X. Normalize X. Save your normalized ndarray as X_normalized.npy

#### **#2 DIVISIBLE BY 3 PROBLEM:** Create a 10-by-10 array which are the squares of the first 100 positive integers. From this ndarray, determine all the elements that are divisible by 3. Save the result as div_by_3.npy
